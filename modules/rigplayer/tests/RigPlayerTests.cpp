    // slot caught MID-FIELD is different in kind, and it was wrong at an UNCHANGED rate too — so this is
    // not a rate-change test that happens to use one rate, it is the other half of the same defect.
    //
    // What is wrong: `prepare()` flushes every network (NamStage::prepare ends in its own restart), so
    // afterwards the slot's model holds NOTHING. The law's ledger, left alone, still credits it every
    // sample it heard before the flush — so a slot that was one block short of audible is marked audible
    // one block later, having fed one block of real material into an empty network. That is invariant 3
    // broken by a whole receptive field, and it costs nothing to close: a warming slot is at weight zero
    // by construction, so re-arming it is inaudible.
    //
    // ⚠️ AND THIS IS THE FIXTURE THAT KILLS THE PLAUSIBLE WRONG FIX. Carrying the warm-up across a
    // restart PROPORTIONALLY — rescaling `fed` alongside `need` so the fraction is preserved — passes
    // every other assertion in this file, because every other fixture restarts a slot that is already
