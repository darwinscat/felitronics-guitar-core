// THE TONE BANDS' COEFFICIENT RAMP HAS A LENGTH OF ITS OWN.
//
// It used to be the host's block: the same turn of the same knob travelled in 0.33 ms at a block of 16
// and 85 ms at 4096, and in 180 SECONDS on the whole-file call an offline driver makes. `bandRampLength`
// reads the length off the band instead — five ring times of its own poles, floored at 64 samples and
// capped at 2048 — so the move is the same however the caller cuts the stream.
//
// WHAT EACH TEST HERE IS FOR. The block-invariance test is the claim; the length tests are what stops it
// being satisfied by a constant. Every fixture asserts a precondition first, because each of these would
// pass on a dead one: a band that does not filter is trivially invariant, and two lengths that are equal
// because both hit the floor prove nothing about the a2 they were supposed to be read from.

// continuous filter state; (B) `takeBands` re-initialising every band on every publish, i.e. reset plus
// jump; (C) the ramp cursor shared across channels, so channel 1 skips the ramp — invisible because
// every other fixture here is MONO. Block-invariance is satisfied by any edit landing on a fixed
// absolute sample, a jump included, so it cannot see (A) or (B); and the "restarted ramp" check reads
// an RMS window where a jump's continuous state sits on the right side of the comparison anyway.
//
// What sees all three is a reference NULL: an oracle built from the primitives — the same designSection
// endpoints, bandRampLength, and the interpolation the header specifies — fed the SAME input through
// one eq::Biquad, with the PLAYER as the thing under test. The replica is legitimate here precisely
