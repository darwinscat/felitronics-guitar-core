# felitronics::rigplayer — the pack player, and what a host owes it

One device of a `.orbitrig` pack, playing. Hand it the pack's structures (`namz::rig::Rig`, as
`namz::rig::loadRigManifest` returns them) and a way to get a file's bytes, tell it where the knobs
stand, feed it audio. Header-only, JUCE-free, no thread of its own. Moved here from OrbitCapture NAM
so the capture app and a plugin play through ONE player; the app is the reference host.

Signal order, per block:

    in → dry copy → pre tone (bands, curve) → chain trim → ┬→ trim A → model A → align ─┐
                                                           └→ trim B → model B → align ─┴→ mix
       → post tone (bands, curve) → dry/wet blend → out

- WHICH files sound is `namz::rig`'s policy (a turned control is law) joined to `pickBlend` along
  the gain dial — `RigSelection.h`, pure.
- WHEN a model may be replaced, and how loudly each is heard, is `felitronics::nam::BlendLaw` — run
  once per block on the audio thread, the only writer of the weight.
- A tone knob plays as the pack describes it: `sections` become biquads, `positions` (a curve)
  become one minimum-phase FIR per side. A blend knob mixes the DI through the dry path's response.
- The models' offsets come from the pack (`lag_samples`); a pack without them can be measured by the
  host (`AlignmentTable`) and handed in.

## Threads — the whole contract

| call | thread |
|---|---|
| `prepare(rate, maxBlock, channels ≤ 2)` | message, never while `process()` runs |
| `load(rig, source)` / `unload()` | message |
| `setDial(name, degrees)` / `setSwitch(name, value)` / `setToneOverride` / `setBlendShape` / `setNormalize` / `setAlignment` / `setColdAfterSeconds` | message |
| `service()` then `takeLoadJob()` | message, from a timer — a few times a second at least |
| `RigPlayer::run(job)` | ANY thread but the audio one — a pool, a worker, or right here |
| `deliver(loaded)` | message — strictly; it installs into the stages |
| `process(io, channels, n)` | audio — allocates nothing, locks nothing, touches no file |
| every read-out (`liveMix`, `heldFileId`, `soundingLoudness`, `selection`, `knobValue`, the drawing readers…) | message |

**Loading is a job the host runs.** `service()` never loads. When the law wants a model,
`takeLoadJob()` hands out ONE job at a time — slot, `files[].id`, the bytes if already fetched, the
`ModelSource`, the numbers the stages were prepared with. `run(job)` is a pure function of it: the
bytes through the source when the job has none, then the heavy half of a load
(`NamStage::prepareModel` — parsing, two instances, the prewarm; some twenty milliseconds for a
WaveNet). `deliver(loaded)` is the light half. **A job taken MUST come back through `deliver()`** —
with a null model if it failed — or the law waits for it forever. A job that returns after `unload()`
is dropped by the player; the host need not track it. `serviceHere()` runs the same path on one
thread, for a host without a worker and for a test.

**`ModelSource` is called from wherever the host runs `run()`.** Make it safe to call off the message
thread: it is called at most once at a time (one job in flight), but not from the thread that opened
the pack. The reference host reads from a `juce::ZipFile` kept open, one entry per call.

**A slot at rest goes cold.** A dial parked on a capture keeps the neighbouring capture in the other
slot at exactly zero, warm and waiting — and its network used to run every block for nothing (measured
in OrbitAmp's block, prepared for two planes and fed one: 4.5 % of a P-core, 14 % of an E-core). After
`RigPlayer::kColdAfterSeconds` (2 s) at exactly zero under an unchanged request the slot goes COLD: its
model is not run — nor mixed — and it stays loaded: nothing is fetched, nothing freed; its delay
line is cleared as it falls asleep, as a landing clears it. The law owns the flag (`BlendState::cold`)
and wakes the slot on the first block of the next change of request, warm-up first — the same
re-landing a load ends with, with the model's own field — so nothing unfed is ever heard, and the
first turn after a rest trails the hand by one warm-up (some 130 ms for a WaveNet, then the ordinary
slew; a model that declares no field is heard at once). A slot with any weight is never cold: between two captures both models run, on one
they do not. `setColdAfterSeconds(s)` sets the rest (zero or less = never); `slotCold(i)` and
`coldBlocks(i)` (since `clearCounters()`) read it out beside `warmBlocks()`, for a dump or a badge.

## What a host must do

1. `prepare()` in the host's own prepare; re-prepare on a rate or block change (the filters are
   designed for a rate; a model built for another rate is prepared again on install).
2. `load()` once per pack/device; the player opens on the pack's defaults (`namz::rig::defaultSettings`)
   and, if that combination was never captured, on the closest one that was.
3. A timer: `service()`, then `while (auto job = takeLoadJob()) …` — run it where you like, bring it
   back with `deliver()` on the message thread.
4. Report `latencySamples()` to the host after every `deliver()` and `prepare()` — it is the models'
   rate-matching; the alignment delays are relative and the reference model carries none.
5. Knobs by NAME, the pack's names: `setDial(name, degrees)` for anything with a sweep (a captured
   dial, a tone knob, a blend knob), `setSwitch(name, value)` for a token. `knobValue(name)` reads
   any of them back as the pack spells it; `dialDegrees()` is the crossfade dial's angle,
   `settings()` the captured combination.

## Levels — what is always applied, and the one thing a host may switch off

The pack's own two levels are applied **always**, from the moment `load()` reads them. They are what
the pack's author decided about this device: `chain[].input_db` is how hard the guitar is fed into it
— the working point, so it changes the sound and not the volume — and `chain[].output_db` is how loud
it leaves, so packs can be balanced against one another.

Where they sit is not decoration. `input_db` goes FIRST, ahead of the dry copy, because a blend knob
mixes one guitar with itself and both ends of that mix must be fed the same signal. `output_db` goes
LAST, after the mix, because it is one number for the whole stage and applied any earlier it would
ride the wet side alone and move the blend the pack states for this position.

`stageInputDb()` / `stageOutputDb()` read back what the PACK states. A host that only plays packs
needs nothing else — the player applies them and there is no switch.

**A host with a fader of its own states the WHOLE number, never a difference.** `setHostInputDb(db)` /
`setHostOutputDb(db)` say "play this device at that level"; the player uses the hand instead of the
pack's own, and `std::nullopt` hands the level back to the pack. The hand survives a `load()` — it
belongs to the bench, not to the pack.

This is not a convenience. A host that subtracts has to know which pack is loaded at the moment it
subtracts, and it reads that from its own document: the document changes when somebody edits it, when
a rebuild is in flight, when a device is switched mid-build. Every one of those leaves the level
wrong, silently, in the same class as the double application these keys were added to end. The player
is the only place that cannot disagree with itself about which pack it holds, so the arithmetic lives
here. `hostInputDb()` / `hostOutputDb()` read the hand back.

`setInputTrims(false)` switches off exactly one thing: `files[].input_db`, the trim of one alias
against its neighbour. It has never reached the pack's own levels and does not reach them now.

**The tag of what is SOUNDING, and the slot trap it exists to close.** `soundingLoudness()` returns
the `metadata.loudness` of the capture the sound is actually leaving by — `db` and `tagged` — never of
whichever model happens to sit in slot 0. Slots go by the PARITY of a capture's place on the dial, so
on an odd rung the whole sound comes out of slot 1 while slot 0 holds the silent neighbour; a face
that read slot 0 named a model nobody could hear, or warned "plays raw" about a capture that carries
a tag.

**During a crossfade there is no single honest number, and this does not invent one.** Two captures
are in the sound with two tags: `db`/`tagged` are the heavier slot's — the one carrying most of the
sound, `slot` says which that is — and `blended` says the other slot holds a DIFFERENT capture and is
audible beside it. So a face can say "one of two", or drop the number entirely while `blended` is
true, instead of stating a level the sound has not got. At the ends of the dial both slots hold the
same capture and `blended` is false however the weight sits. The weight it reads is the APPLIED one
(`liveMix()`), not the requested one: while a model is still loading or warming, the slot that IS the
sound is the old one. `tagged` is false both for a model without a tag and for a slot with no model
at all — `heldFileId(slot)` tells those two apart. It describes the MODEL mix alone: a blend knob at
its dry end takes every model out of the sound and says nothing here.

`setNormalize()` defaults to **true**. A model's `metadata.loudness` tag is a contract, not a
listener's option: with it off, every capture plays at whatever level the hardware happened to give,
and no two packs can be compared at all. A host may turn it off to hear a model against the hardware,
and should make that state loud — it is a measuring position, not a way to listen.

## Drawing — the one honest source of the curve

The tone as it PLAYS, not as it was measured: `commonGrid()` (1/12-octave, 20 Hz – 20 kHz) with
`curveDb(side)` — the summed curve-form knobs of a side, empty when none — and `curveActive(side)`
(a FIR, or a wire); `bands(side)` — the biquads of the section-form knobs at their current
positions; `blendGains()` — the dry and wet gains for the blend knob's position. A host that draws
from these draws what is sounding; recomputing from the pack's ladders draws something else.

## Not the player's business

The source (a loop, the jack), a cabinet IR, output routing, a pre-model trim the bench owns, level
metering, presets — the chain AROUND the player. In OrbitCapture NAM that is `AuditionEngine`
(the JUCE audio side) and `AuditionController` (the message-thread wiring, the pool that runs jobs).
