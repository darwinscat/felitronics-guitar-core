// felitronics::rigplayer — HOW FAR APART THE MODELS OF ONE DEVICE LAND. Two captures of one pedal
// come out of training shifted by a few samples; crossfaded as they are, the pair combs. The reading is
// a relation between two files, re-measured whenever a pack is built — which is whenever a model could
// have changed — and THE PACK CARRIES IT: `lag_samples` on every file entry (NAMZ-FORMAT.md), measured
// by the capture side with every model in hand. A player takes it from there (fromDevice) and delays
// the earlier models so any pair lines up.
//
// For a pack that does not carry it, the same measurement is here: half a second of broadband through
// each model, a normalized cross-correlation against the first — a pure function over bytes, heavy
// (NAM inference per file), for the host to run on whatever thread it likes and hand to the player.
// Nothing here touches audio hardware or the player's state.
