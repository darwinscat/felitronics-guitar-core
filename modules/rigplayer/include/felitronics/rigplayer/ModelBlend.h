// felitronics::rigplayer — WHICH TWO MODELS SOUND AT THIS KNOB POSITION, AND IN WHAT PROPORTION.
//
// A gain knob is captured at a handful of angles and the hand stops anywhere. The rule here is the
// simplest one that can work, and it is deliberately not a measurement:
//
//     the two neighbouring captures play together, mixed by ANGLE.
//
// No decibels are fitted, nothing has to be trained before the dial works, and no position can fall
// into a hole. It rests on a fact about how this library is shot rather than on a theory: the angles
// are dense enough that stepping between them without any crossfade already sounds acceptable, so
// anything smooth between two of them is at least as good. A fitted drive curve would buy accuracy
// that nobody listens for, at hours of inference per device.
//
// TWO EXCEPTIONS, both asked for by the bench:
//
// OUTSIDE THE CAPTURED RANGE, THE NEAREST CAPTURE IS FED DIFFERENTLY. The dial turns its whole
// travel whatever was shot on it: below the lowest capture that one plays SOFTER, above the highest
// it plays HARDER, both at the rate below. Downwards is the safe direction — less signal into a model
// keeps it inside what it was trained on — and upwards is admitted extrapolation, which exists
// because a dial that physically reaches 17h with its last capture at 15h has a dead top, the exact
// complaint this mechanism was built to cure. The rate is a starting guess for the ear, not a reading.

namespace felitronics::rigplayer {

// How much harder the top capture is driven per degree past it. A guess, and printed in the player's
// dump so it can be argued with: measured 30-degree spans in this library run 0.5 to 6.5 dB, and the
// ones at the TOP of a dial are the small ones — a saturating stage stops answering. So the rate is
// taken from that end, not from the average, and a full two hours past the last capture adds ~3 dB.

    int    lo = -1, hi = -1;   // indices into the knot list; equal = one model alone; -1 = nothing to play
    double mixHi = 0.0;        // weight of `hi`; `lo` gets 1 - mixHi
    double extendDb = 0.0;     // extra drive into the model, above the top knot only
};

// WHERE THE HANDOVER SITS AND HOW WIDE IT IS — the two numbers the bench turns.
//
// The original law faded across the WHOLE gap, so the handover was always at the midpoint and always
// as wide as the gap allowed. Both are voicing decisions, not facts: on a dial whose captures are 30
// degrees apart, "the next model starts a third of the way up, and takes ten degrees to arrive" is a
// different instrument from "half way, and instantly" — and only an ear can say which is the pedal.
//
//   point  0.01 … 0.99  where the 50/50 lands, as a fraction of the gap between the two captures.
//   width  0 … 1        how much of the room on EACH SIDE of that point the fade uses. Each side is
//                       measured against its own distance to its own capture, so the two halves are
//                       free to differ: at a point of 10% and a width of 90% the fade starts just
//                       above the lower capture and finishes just short of the upper one, arriving
//                       early and taking its time. Measuring both halves against the NEARER capture —
//                       which is what this did first — made 90% mean a band of ±9% and left nine
//                       tenths of the span unused (visible on the plot). Zero is a hard switch AT
//                       the point; no width can reach past a capture into the next gap.
//
// The defaults reproduce the original law exactly (midpoint, full span), so a caller that says nothing
// gets what it always got.
