// felitronics::rigplayer — ONE DEVICE OF A PACK, PLAYING. Hand it the pack's structures
// (namz::rig — the manifest as the canonical reader returns it) and a way to get a file's bytes, tell it
// where the knobs stand, feed it audio. It does, in signal order:
//
//     in → pack in → dry copy → pre tone (bands, curve) → chain trim → ┬→ trim A → model A → align ─┐
//                                                                      └→ trim B → model B → align ─┴→ mix
//        → post tone (bands, curve) → dry/wet blend → pack out → out
//
//   • WHICH files play is namz::rig's policy (a turned control is law) joined to ModelBlend.h's pair
//     along the gain dial — RigSelection.h, pure.
//   • WHEN a model may be replaced, and how loudly each is heard, is felitronics::nam::BlendLaw —
//     run here once per block on the audio thread, the only writer of the weight. The message thread
//     posts a request and answers load asks; two one-way mailboxes, no locks. A load itself — bytes
//     fetched, a network built and warmed, some twenty milliseconds for a WaveNet — is a JOB the
//     player hands out (takeLoadJob) and the host runs where it likes (run, any thread) before
//     bringing it back (deliver): no thread of its own, no policy, no hiccup on the drawing thread.
//   • A slot that has stood silent under an unchanged request for kColdAfterSeconds goes COLD and its
//     model stops being run on audio — a dial parked on a capture costs one network, not two. It is
//     still HANDED the call, at width zero, until the stage has drained the silence it owes (law 11c);
//     sleeping is inaudible AT THE MODEL RATE and, off it, costs the woken slot's rate-matcher latency
//     once on the block of the wake (4.97e-03 at 44.1 kHz against a 0.1 input) — see warmFor;
//     that is one bounded drain per sleep and nothing after it, and without it the slot replayed what
//     it was holding when it fell asleep — 0.500000 out of digital silence. The law owns the flag
//     (BlendState::cold) and wakes the slot, warm-up first, the moment the request changes; the model
//     stays where it is throughout. slotCold() and coldBlocks() read it out.
//   • A tone knob is applied as the pack describes it — a curve becomes a minimum-phase FIR, bands
//     become biquads — on the side of the models its circuit puts it. ToneKnobs.h, pure.
//   • A blend knob mixes the DI the models were fed, through the dry path's own response. BlendKnob.h.
//   • THE PACK'S OWN TWO LEVELS BRACKET EVERYTHING IT DOES. `chain[].input_db` is the level of the
//     guitar into this device, and it goes FIRST — ahead of the dry copy, because a blend knob mixes
//     one guitar with itself and both ends must be fed the same signal. `chain[].output_db` is the
//     level the device leaves at, and it goes LAST, after the mix, so balancing one pack against
//     another cannot move the blend the pack was told to hold. Neither is behind setInputTrims():
//     they are the author's statement about the pack, not a listener's option.
//   • The slot trims are the files' own `input_db` — a linked setting plays its neighbour softer, and
//     this is the one thing setInputTrims() switches off — and the chain trim is the extension past
//     the ends of the captured range, which the dry path never saw either.
//   • The models' offsets are measured from the bytes (AlignmentTable.h) by the host, on any thread,
//     and handed in; each slot's delay travels with its model and lands when the slot is silent.
//
// NOTHING OF THE LIBRARY IS KNOWN HERE — no take, no database, no file system, no JUCE. The bytes come
// through ModelSource by `files[].id`, when the law asks and never before: a swept dial fetches each
// capture once. This is the unit that leaves for the plugin as one directory.
//
// Threads, exactly as NamStage: prepare() / load() / the knob setters / service() / takeLoadJob() /
// deliver() on the message thread; run() on any thread but the audio one; process() alone on the audio
// thread — it allocates nothing, locks nothing, touches no file. The read-outs are atomics.

    // HOW LONG A COEFFICIENT MOVE TAKES, and it is READ OFF THE BAND rather than chosen or inherited.
    //
    // It used to be the host's block: the coefficients travelled linearly across whatever `process()`
    // was handed, so the same turn of the same knob took 0.33 ms at a block of 16 and 85 ms at 4096 —
    // 180 SECONDS on the whole-file call an offline driver makes. A spread of 500000x is not a
    // behaviour, so there was nothing to preserve; what there was instead was a question with no
    // number in the file, and this is that number.
    //
    // WHAT SETS IT. A biquad cannot be moved faster than it forgets: its poles sit at radius
    // r = sqrt(|a2|), the impulse response decays as r^n, and a move completed well inside that decay
    // asks the filter to be somewhere its own state has not caught up to. So ONE ring time — the
    // filter's own -60 dB memory — is the length, and the two rails below are what keep that honest.
    //
    // THERE IS NO KNEE, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS NOTE CLAIMED ONE. The transient a fast move adds
    // over the ideal is +14.88 dB at L = 1, +3.13 at 64, +0.93 at 256, +0.50 at 512, +0.13 at 2048 —
    // which LOOKS like it flattens, and does not: as a linear excess it is L x excess = 27.8, 28.9,
    // 30.3, 30.9, i.e. a plain 1/L all the way down. So no length is "where the artefact stops"; every
    // doubling halves it, for ever, and the number is a CHOSEN TOLERANCE dressed as physics if it is
    // stated any other way. The adiabatic error behaves the same, ~3 dB per doubling with no knee
    // either.
    //
    // WHAT THE MULTIPLIER IS, then: a responsiveness policy, and ONE ring is defended UNIVERSALLY rather
    // than from the only pack that exists — appealing to that pack is over-fitting, and an earlier
    // version of this note did exactly that on a reading taken at a BLIND PROBE FREQUENCY. It said the
    // pack's bass shelf "overshoots 0.00 dB at every length"; that was measured at 90 Hz and 1400 Hz,
    // both outside the shelf's transition band. Inside it the same move reads +3.04 dB at L = 1, +1.41
    // at 64 and +0.20 at one ring (436 samples) on a 334 Hz probe, and the OTHER direction (+6 -> -12)
    // reads +17.19 dB at 42 Hz on an instantaneous jump. The pack's own knob was never free.
    //
    // The universal statement, measured across every shape tried (Q 1.4 bell, the pack shelf, a 400 Hz
    // Q 0.3 bell, a 300 Hz Q 0.5, a 1 kHz Q 0.7 at -24 dB, a 100 Hz Q 8, a Q 2, an 80 Hz Q 0.3 shelf):
    // AT EXACTLY ONE RING the peak excess over the ideal move on a FULL-SWING SLAM is +0.24 to +1.06 dB.
    // That is a property of the ramp-to-ring ratio, not of a pack, because the excess falls as 1/L.
    // Five rings buys 5x less (+0.05 to +0.25) for 5x the lag. One ring also lands the pack's bass knob
    // at 9.1 ms, which is what a 512-sample host was already producing — a tie-breaker, not the reason.
    //
    // ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT COVER THE PACK'S SWITCH, whatever an earlier version of this note said. That
    // switch's two positions carry ZERO and ONE section, so flipping it changes the BAND COUNT, and
    // `takeBands` starts an appearing band AT its coefficients with reset state — measured through the
    // player, the output matches a static "smooth" render from ELEVEN samples after the flip, where a
    // 64-sample ramp would need at least 64. An appearance is a hard step today. Ramping it from
    // identity (a stable endpoint, and the stability triangle is convex so the linear path stays
    // stable) and draining a disappearing band back to identity is a separate policy — P26 follow-up.
    //
    // THE FLOOR IS A RAIL, NOT A GUARANTEE, and the difference is the part that is easy to overclaim.
    // Every band in the reference pack (namz conformance `rig-measured`: a 167 Hz Q 0.58 low shelf
    // travelling [-12, +6] dB with its corner over [120, 240] Hz, a 1077 Hz Q 0.65 tilt, a 10 kHz
    // Q 0.8 switch position) is a shelf or tilt with Q BELOW ONE, and on those the adiabatic error is
    // already -47 dB at an INSTANTANEOUS jump. But 64 samples does NOT bound the artefact in general:
    // a schema-legal 5 kHz bell at Q 1.4 swept +12 -> -12 dB is handed exactly 64 by the rule above and
    // overshoots by 0.67 dB there (1.49 dB at the worst edit phase), falling as 1/L to 0.11 dB at 512.
    // 64 is where the lag budget starts, chosen so an ordinary knob is not made sluggish; a move large
    // and sharp enough will exceed it, and that is stated rather than hidden.
    //
    // THE CEILING IS A LAG BUDGET, not a DSP one, which is why it is a named constant and not a
    // formula: a band that rings 176 ms (a 100 Hz bell at Q 8 — the pack schema permits it, nothing
    // in `namz_rig_load.h` bounds `hz` or `q` beyond "positive") would ask for 880 ms, and a knob that
    // trails the hand by a second is broken in a different way. Past the ceiling the move is honestly
    // too fast for the filter and the overshoot above is what it costs.
    // THE RAILS ARE TIME, and the first version had them in SAMPLES — which is the same defect as the
    // one this whole change removes, one scale down. A ring is a duration: a 167 Hz shelf rings 9.08 ms
    // at every rate. Rails in samples do not: 2048 is 46.4 ms at 44.1 kHz, 42.7 at 48, **21.3 at 96 and
    // 10.7 at 192**, so the same pack gets a quarter of the budget on a 192 kHz session, and a 100 Hz
    // Q 2 bell swept +-12 dB costs +1.5 dB of overshoot at 42.7 ms against **+4.7 dB at 10.7**.

    //
    // WHAT IT PROMISES: nothing the caller fed before this call can be heard after it. Every place in
    // this player that holds samples is emptied — both models and their rate-matchers, the three
    // convolvers (bypassed or not — a bypassed one is SKIPPED, so its history freezes and is replayed
    // when the curve comes back), the dry path's alignment ring, the two per-slot whole-sample
    // alignment tails, the band filters, and the block scratch. The exceptions are the NAM stage's
    // three, word for word, because they are its: a recurrent cell, a capture whose conditioner is a
    // model of its own, and NAM's own partitioned-FFT clock.
    //
    // WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH, because none of it is audio the caller fed:
    //   · THE BLEND LAW's state — which capture is held, which is wanted, the applied weight, the cold
    //     flags, a load in flight, a load refused. A restart is not a device change. In particular it
    //     does NOT re-arm `fed[]` for a slot that is ALREADY AUDIBLE — a slot still WARMING is the one
    //     exception, re-armed below, see the end of this function and nam::blendRestated. The case for
    //     re-arming an audible slot is that after `nam_[i].reset()` the network is back in the
    //     just-landed state, so the law's ledger reads "warm" for a flushed network.
    //     The case against won, on three counts, and the third is the one that decides it:
    //       (1) invariant 3 protects the stream's CONSISTENCY — a slot that missed the last 132 ms
    //           beside one that heard it. A restart zeroes the past of both slots AND the dry ring
    //           together, so there is nothing for the incoming slot to be inconsistent with;
    //       (2) every other stage here (the convolvers, the bands, the dry ring) restarts to the zero
    //           state and is heard on the very next block. A model is not special;
    //       (3) re-arming would not even deliver the invariant. With `fed = 0` on both slots the law
    //           holds the weight and ramps its gain DOWN over 1/maxDeltaPerBlock = 4 blocks, so the
    //           by-hypothesis wrong-sounding network is audible anyway, at up to unity, for those four
    //           blocks. What it buys is a hole: simulated on a 6859-sample field at 48 kHz with a
    //           512-sample block, 18 blocks disturbed — 43 ms of fade-out, 107 ms of mute, 43 ms of
    //           fade-in — at every restart. Re-arming only the SOUNDING slot is worse still: the law
    //           rails the goal to the neighbour (`unsafe0 && ! unsafe1` -> goal 1.0) and plays a full
    //           spurious crossfade to the other capture and back.
    //     `blendLanded()` is in any case the wrong tool for it: it also clears `inFlight` (a second
    //     load could then be asked for a slot that already has one out), `cold`, `still` and `refused`
    //     (a capture that deterministically fails would be asked for again — the storm the law exists
    //     to prevent).
    //   · the request, the pack, the alignment table, the dials, the host's trims, the gains' TARGETS.
    //
    // WHAT IT SNAPS rather than clears: the gain ramps and the band ramps. Those are control history,
    // not audio, but a restart restarts the parameter epoch too — `eq::EqBand::reset()` settled this
    // for the house, and it settled it with a number: a band left mid-ramp made a second render of the
    // same programme differ from a fresh one by 0.51 FULL SCALE. The numbers snapped to are exactly
    // the ones prepare() snaps to, so the two verbs agree by construction rather than by review.
    //
    // ⚠️ THE PRICE IS FOUR NETWORKS, not one. Each `NamStage` charges a whole drain length of inference
    // per lane that has been fed, and this player holds TWO of them, each of which can be running two
    // lanes — so a stereo host with both slots sounding pays 4 x that stage's figure (a real Standard
    // WaveNet is 3.77 ms per lane at a 64-sample block). It is idempotent exactly as the stage's is:
    // the debt is re-armed only by audio actually being fed, a sleeping slot mid-drain pays only the
    // remainder, and a mono host pays for half of it — and a lane whose falling-edge drain already ran
    // to the end pays nothing here (its debt is spent). Until P90 such a lane was billed again by the NEXT
    // prepare() — 5124 where 2562 was owed — because only a restart cleared the stage's "may be holding
    // audio" flag; this verb itself never charged it. Callable from the audio thread — nothing here
    // allocates, locks, throws or touches a field the message thread owns — and NOT free there. The

        // whatever was playing when it fell asleep, and the stage's own ledger knows exactly how much
        // of that is left (a spent drain is not a clean lane for a recurrent capture — the stage reads
        // the state, not the counter). A slot whose re-prepare was REFUSED writes nothing, and needs no

    // WHAT prepare() PROMISES ABOUT HOST-DEPENDENT STATE, which is the sentence the mechanism below
    // serves: after it returns, NOTHING the player will act on is expressed in the samples of a rate it
    // is no longer running at. The rate-designed things were already covered — the FIRs are redesigned,
    // the bands redesigned and retired, the dry aligner re-sized, both stages re-prepared, the cold
    // threshold recomputed from its SECONDS. What was not covered is everything that is a COUNT of host
    // samples, and there are two such families, both written once and read for ever:
    //
    //   · THE WARM-UP LEDGER — `blend_.need[i]`, latched from warmFor() at the landing, and read again at
    //     every WAKE of a cold slot. See nam::blendRestated, which owns the numbers and the reasoning:
    //     the warm-up did not depend on the new rate at all, so a slot woken after 48 -> 96 kHz warmed
    //     for half the field it owes, and after 48 -> 192 for a quarter.
    //   · THE ALIGNMENT DELAYS — `pendDelay_` and `slotDelay_`, which AlignmentTable::delayOf scales by
    //     the host rate, and which only stageDelays() and a landing ever wrote. Left stale, the two
    //     captures of one device are held apart by a number measured for a different rate, so the
    //     crossfade combs by (ratio − 1) x the delay. A staged delay lands only on a slot at weight zero,
    //     so a SOUNDING slot kept the stale number until the dial moved it to silence.
    //
    // WHY THE TWO DELAYS ARE DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT MODELS, which looks like an inconsistency and is the
    // point: `pendDelay_` is the PLAN's — the model the dial is asking for — because that is what a
    // staged retime is, while `slotDelay_` is the delay of the model actually IN the slot. In the common
    // case they name one capture and get one number. When a load is in flight they do not, and taking
    // both from the plan would apply the incoming model's delay to the one still playing. Snapping
    // `slotDelay_` outright is right here and only here: prepare() is never concurrent with process(),
    // clearAudioState() has just zeroed `lagTail_`, so there is no signal to splice and no click to hide
    // from — which is the same reason snapGains() snaps rather than ramps.
    //
    // ⚠️ AND A LANDING CAN BE IN FLIGHT ACROSS THIS CALL. `loadSlot()` runs on the message thread and
    // latches `landWarm_`/`landDelay_` at the rate of the moment; the audio thread consumes them on its
    // next block. A prepare() landing between those two instants would hand the law a warm-up and a
    // delay measured for the rate that has just gone. The model itself is fine — it is re-prepared —
    // so only the two numbers need restating, and they are restated from the stage that now holds it.
    //
    // ⚠️ AND A FORGET IN FLIGHT MEANS THERE IS NO LEDGER TO RESTATE. load() and unload() post `forget_`
    // and rebuild `models_` at once, but the audio thread wipes `blend_` only on its NEXT block — so a
    // prepare() in that window finds `blend_.held[]` naming the PREVIOUS pack's models, as indices into a
    // `models_` that now belongs to the new one. Resolving them here reads the old slot's delay out of
    // the NEW pack's table: measured, a pack whose table owed 96 was applied to both slots of the pack
    // before it. That is muted and heals within a block, and it is still a change to base behaviour in a
    // window this function was never written for — so it stands back, and leaves the audio thread to
    // wipe what it was always going to wipe. The PLAN's delays are still restated: `plan_` is the new
    // pack's, and they are exactly what that first block will snap into place.
    //
    // `still` is the one count here that is RESCALED rather than recomputed — see nam::blendRestated for
    // why it is exact for that count and a trap for `need`. The ratio needs the rate the ledger was
    // COUNTED in, and that is not reliably `fs_` from before this call: prepare() writes `fs_` ahead of
    // two sub-prepares whose refusal it honours by returning false (no input reaches that refusal today,
    // since their channel and rate arguments are validated first — the order is what is relied on, not
    // the luck), and a refused prepare leaves the player unable to process, so the ledger never advanced
    // at the rate it wrote. `ledgerFs_` moves only here, at the end of a
