// felitronics::nam — WHO IS AUDIBLE, HOW LOUDLY, AND WHEN A MODEL MAY BE REPLACED.
//
// Two model slots play the same input and are mixed linearly; a knob between two captures asks for a
// fraction of each. That much is arithmetic. What is not arithmetic — and what cost a day of chasing
// crackle by ear — is WHO decides the number. This header exists because that answer must be "one
// thing, and it is testable without a sound card".
//
// THE FAILURE THIS PREVENTS. In the player this replaces, three separate places wrote the mix or
// swapped a model: the blend itself, the code that follows the nearest capture, and a warm-up gate
// bolted on later. None was wrong alone. Together they replaced models under a live gain and drove
// the weight across its whole range inside single 10 ms blocks. Measured on one sweep of a nine-
// capture device: 62 model loads, 401 parked retries, and a full 1.000 swing of the weight.
//
// SO: one writer, one recurrence, and every property below provable by construction rather than by
// listening.
//
//   1. The applied weight moves by at most `maxDeltaPerBlock` per block. There is no other writer,
//      so no path — a load, a device change, a give-up, a mode flip — can step it.
//   2. A model is replaced only in a slot whose applied weight is exactly zero.
//   3. A model that has not yet been fed its receptive field is never audible. Its weight is zero,
//      not small: a network that has not heard the last 132 ms does not produce a quiet version of
//      the right sound, it produces the wrong sound.
//   4. Progress is guaranteed without timeouts. Whenever a slot holds the wrong model, some slot's
//      goal is zero and the recurrence reaches it in a bounded number of blocks.
//
// WHAT GIVES, since something must: not (1) and not (3) — they constrain a value and a derivative
// and are compatible. What gives is INSTANTANEOUS ACCURACY. Crossing a capture, the incoming model
// arrives about 132 ms late and the outgoing capture carries alone until it does. That is a morph
// that trails the hand, which is what a person hears as a knob rather than as a fault.
//
// AND ONE ECONOMY, added after the law had settled: a slot that stands at EXACTLY zero under an
// unchanged request for longer than the host allows goes COLD. The host stops running its model — the
// model stays where it is, nothing is unloaded — and the law counts the slot unfed from then on,
// because it is. The next change of request wakes it by the path a landing takes (fed back to zero,
// the same receptive field to serve), so (3) holds across a sleep exactly as it holds across a load,
// and the price is the one already paid at every crossing: the first turn after a rest trails the hand
// by one warm-up. A slot with any weight at all is never cold, so a pair sounding together stays two
// passes, as it must; a dial parked on a capture costs one.

// 🔴 THE HOST RATE MOVED, AND THREE OF THIS LEDGER'S NUMBERS ARE HOST SAMPLES. `need` is a count of them
// (NamStage::prewarmSamples() converted, plus the rate-matcher's latency, plus one block — see
// rigplayer::RigPlayer::warmFor), and until P89 nothing recomputed it when the host handed the player a
// new rate: it was written once, at the landing, and read for ever after — including by the WAKE at the
// top of blendStep(), which re-arms a cold slot with `s.need[i]` exactly as it stands.
//
// WHAT THAT COST, measured through the player on a 6x6 grid of host rates, two block sizes and three
// shapes (a 2001-tap Linear, an untagged one, a WaveNet): the warm-up a woken slot is held for does not
// depend on the new rate AT ALL. It is, sample for sample, the warm-up the slot had at the rate its model
// landed at — so the error tracks fs_landed/fs_now (roughly: the latency and block terms do not scale, so
// 44.1 -> 96 kHz reads 0.469 where the bare ratio is 0.459). 48 -> 96 kHz warms a slot for 2048 host
// samples where 4096 are owed — half a field, which is invariant 3 broken in the direction the law calls
// the bad one. 48 -> 192 kHz warms for a quarter. The other direction over-warms: 192 -> 48 kHz holds a
// slot silent four times longer than it needs.
//
// ⚠️ AND A ONE-POINT FIXTURE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT CLEAN. Of the 180 cells, 85 under-warm, 85 over-warm,
// and exactly 10 read right — eight of them 44.1 <-> 48 kHz, the two rates nearly every session on earth
// uses, and the other two 88.2 <-> 96 on the WaveNet at a 256-sample block. A fixture reaching for the
// obvious pair sits on the one place the defect is invisible. This is P85's lesson with a second set of
// numbers.
//
// WHAT THIS VERB DOES, and it is NOT blendLanded(). A restart is not a landing: it must not clear
// `inFlight` (a second load could then be asked for a slot that already has one out), nor `cold`, nor
// `refused` (a capture that deterministically fails would be asked for again — the storm the law exists
// to prevent). It restates the three numbers that are in host samples and nothing else:
//
//   · `need` is recomputed by the caller, at the NEW rate, from the model actually in the slot, and
//     handed in. It is not RESCALED from the old one: `need` is not homogeneous in the rate — only the
//     receptive-field term scales, while the rate-matcher's latency is 0 at 48 kHz, 61 at 44.1 and 96 at
//     96 kHz, and the `+ maxBlock` term does not scale at all. Rescaling would be a restatement of
//     warmFor() with a different answer, which is the disease this tree keeps curing.
//
//   · `fed` is mapped BY ITS PREDICATE, not by its value, and that is the whole of the design. The only
//     thing anything reads `fed` for is `fed >= need` (audible(), and the wasFed gate in blendStep), so
//     what must be preserved across a restart is the ANSWER to that question, not the count:
//       - a slot that was AUDIBLE stays audible (`fed = need`). Re-arming it to zero would mute a
//         sounding capture at every prepare() — and RigPlayer::reset()'s three reasons for not re-arming
//         `fed` transfer to a rate change one for one, the third most of all: the law would ramp the
//         weight down over four blocks, so the by-hypothesis wrong network is audible anyway, and what
//         the re-arm buys is a HOLE (fade-out, mute for a whole field, fade-in) at every transport start.
//       - a slot that was still WARMING is re-armed to zero, and this is free rather than a cost: such a
//         slot is at weight zero by construction (a landing happens only at zero, and the goal rails away
//         from an unsafe slot), and the restart has just FLUSHED its network — so crediting it the field
//         it heard before the flush is the very defect above, in its worst form. It is also the one thing
//         here that was wrong at an UNCHANGED rate too.
//     ⚠️ SCALING `fed` BY THE RATE RATIO IS THE TRAP, and it flips the predicate rather than preserving
//     it: 96 -> 48 kHz on a slot that had just become audible gives `fed·0.5 = pre/2 + 48 + B/2` against
//     `need = pre/2 + B`, which is short whenever the block exceeds 96 samples — i.e. always. The slot
//     goes inaudible, the law rails the goal to its neighbour, and a spurious full crossfade plays.
//
//   · `still` is RESCALED by `timeScale` (new rate / the rate the ledger was counted in), and here —
//     alone of the three — rescaling is the exact answer rather than the trap. `still` is nothing but
//     accumulated host samples of elapsed time at rest (`still += blockSamples`), with no latency term
//     and no block term, so it IS homogeneous in the rate: multiplying by the ratio preserves the
//     elapsed time exactly. Left alone, a partial count in the old rate's units is measured against
//     `coldAfterSamples`, which the host DOES recompute — 192 -> 48 kHz puts a slot to sleep at once,
//     48 -> 192 postpones it by up to a cold window.
//     ⚠️ ZEROING IT WAS THE FIRST DRAFT, and it was a behaviour change hiding as a cleanup: at an
//     UNCHANGED rate — every same-rate prepare(), which is the common case, and every reset() — it
//     postponed sleep by a whole cold window at each call, so a host restarting at every transport
//     start ran a parked dial's second network for two extra seconds each time. The ratio is exactly 1
//     there, so rescaling changes nothing where nothing changed.
//
