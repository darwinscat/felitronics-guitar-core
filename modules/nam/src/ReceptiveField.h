// HOW MUCH SIGNAL A MODEL NEEDS BEFORE ITS OUTPUT MEANS ANYTHING. A network started with empty
// buffers describes the silence it was born into for as long as its memory reaches back, so anything
// that fades a freshly loaded model in has to wait this long first.
//
// NAM answers this itself for convnet and lstm, and a container forwards to its active submodel —
// but the SlimmableContainer of WaveNets that nearly every capture is answers zero
// (`wavenet/slimmable.h`), and `Linear` inherits the base class's zero. Hence this: the receptive
// field read straight off the config — one dilated convolution at a time where there are layers to
// walk, the plain `receptive_field` number where the architecture simply states it, and a named
// CEILING where the config is a shape this file cannot place at all.
//
// 🔴 WHAT THIS FILE PROMISES IS AN UPPER BOUND ON THE MEMORY OF THE WHOLE MODEL, NOT THE FIELD OF ITS
// STACK. A .nam config nests whole models in two places, and NAM builds both by handing the sub-node
// straight back to `get_dsp()`:
//   `config.submodels[i].model` — a container, one of which is SPEAKING          (container.cpp:163)
//   `config.condition_dsp`      — the CONDITIONER, which is always RUNNING       (wavenet/model.cpp:844)
// Those two are the complete list at this pin: they are the only `get_dsp()` calls in the library
// outside `get_dsp.cpp` itself, and the third one (`wavenet/slimmable.cpp:442`) rebuilds that SAME
// `condition_dsp` node. (A THIRD place a whole config can hang — the slimmable wrapper's `config.model`,
// handed to `parse_config_json` rather than to `get_dsp()` — is the reason for the ceiling rule below,
// and it is deliberately NOT added to this list by name: see `forEachUnplacedConfig`.)
// A container is answered for with the WORST of its submodels, because any of
// them can be the one playing. A conditioner is answered for with a SUM, because it is in SERIES:
// `_process_condition` runs the raw input through it and the layer arrays are then processed against
// its output (`wavenet/model.cpp:699-729, :749-761`), so the network's window reaches back through
// the conditioner's. NAM's own arithmetic composes them the same way — `mPrewarmSamples` starts at
// the conditioner's prewarm and ADDS the stack (`wavenet/model.cpp:616-620`).
//
// 🔴 THE SUM IS AN UPPER BOUND AND NOT THE EXACT REACH, AND THE SLACK IS NAMED. The condition enters
// each layer AFTER that layer's dilated convolution (`z = conv(input) + input_mixin(condition)`,
// `wavenet/model.cpp:196-204`; the mixin is a memoryless Conv1x1, `wavenet/detail.h:47-49`), so the
// deepest path out of the conditioner skips the FIRST convolution's own lookback L₀. The true reach
// is `Mₒ + H + max(0, M_c − L₀)` and this file answers `Mₒ + H + M_c + 1`: over by `L₀ + 1`, never
// short. That formula is not reasoning, it is measured — an impulse against digital silence, bit
// compared, four shapes including the branch where the conditioner is SHORTER than L₀:
//     dilations {1,64,256}, no conditioner                      reach  321, answered  322
//     …with a 1000-sample conditioner                           reach 1320, answered 1322
//     …and a head kernel of 9 on top of that                    reach 1328, answered 1330
//     dilations {500,64} with a 100-sample conditioner          reach  564, answered  665
// (the last one is `max(0, M_c − L₀) == 0`: a conditioner that reaches back less far than the first
// convolution adds nothing to the model's memory, and the over-estimate there is the whole M_c.)
// `conv_pre_film` would put L₀ in series too (`wavenet/model.cpp:172-177`), which only makes the sum
// tighter, never wrong.
//
// With SEVERAL layer arrays the bound is looser again, and by the same amount NAM's own arithmetic is:
// an array's head outputs are copied into the NEXT array's head accumulator (`model.cpp:434-447`), so
// the head rechannels are in SERIES, while the residual path into the next array's convolutions
// BYPASSES this array's head. The true reach across a junction is `M_A + max(H_A, M_B) + H_B`, and both
// this file and `mPrewarmSamples` sum the two terms instead of taking the larger. Measured on three
// two-array stacks — {d=1,hk=2}+{d=1,hk=2} reaches 3 and both answer 5; {d=1,hk=64}+{d=100,hk=2}
// reaches 102 and both answer 166; {d=1,hk=100}+{d=8,hk=2} reaches 101 and both answer 110. Over in
// every case, and never looser than the number NAM would have used on its own.
//
// 🔴 AND WHAT IT ANSWERS FOR A CONFIG IT CANNOT PLACE: A CEILING, NEVER ZERO. This file promises a
// BOUND and not an exact value, so "I do not know" has a natural answer and it is not zero. The costs
// are asymmetric and so is the rule: an understated number is the tail of the previous sound coming
// out of digital silence, an overstated one is inference nobody hears. `kUnreadShapeCeiling` below is
// that answer, with its measured price beside it.
//
// WHAT MADE THE RULE NECESSARY — measured on a REAL SHIPPED CAPTURE, not a toy. There is no registered
// `"SlimmableWavenet"` architecture, so the route in is `"WaveNet"`, whose parser delegates when a
// TOP-LEVEL `config.layers[i].slimmable.method` marker is present (`wavenet/model.cpp:1205-1229`), and
// the parser it delegates to then takes the REAL config from `config.model` when that key is there and
// from the config itself when it is not (`wavenet/slimmable.cpp:544`). A config carrying both the
// marker and `config.model` therefore loads, and everything this file used to read was in the half NAM
// ignores. Take NAM's own `example_models/slimmable_wavenet.nam`, move its config under `config.model`,
// leave a top-level `layers` carrying nothing but the marker, and it is the same capture making the
// same sound: the impulse reaches sample 2046 either way, NAM's own `GetPrewarmSamples()` is `return 0`
// for the architecture (`wavenet/slimmable.h:66`) so `NamStage.cpp:78`'s max() raises nothing, and this
// file answered 2047 for the flat file and ZERO for the wrapped one. All three readers were blind
// together: with an LSTM conditioner inside the wrapper `isRecurrent` went true → FALSE while the
// impulse never died, and with a dense `Linear` conditioner the ring went 2048 → 0 and the field
// 4047 → 0 for a model reaching 4042.
//
// AND THE RULE IS NOT A PATCH FOR THAT ONE ADDRESS. The same class — a config whose memory this file
// cannot derive, answered with a number anyway — had further members, all measured on loaded models:
//   a `Linear` of 5000 dense taps carrying a READABLE stray `layers` array answered 2 for an impulse
//   reaching 4999, because the stack reading silenced the declared field;
//   a `ConvNet` carrying a NON-EMPTY dead `layers` array answered 0 where NAM's field is 256, because
//   `convNetField` suppressed itself for it;
//   a SLIMMABLE WaveNet spelling a dilation past the int (`4294967396`, which NAM builds as 100)
//   answered 0, because a refused value read as absent.
// One rule closes all of them, and it is stated where the numbers meet (`placedField` and the block
// above `kUnreadShapeCeiling`): WHAT THIS FILE PLACES, IT TRUSTS; FOR WHAT IT CANNOT PLACE — AN UNREAD
// CONFIG, A REFUSED VALUE, A READING IT SETS ASIDE — IT CHARGES ONE ALLOWANCE, NEVER THE FACE VALUE AND
// NEVER NOTHING. The review rounds that shaped it measured both failures of the simpler rules: face
// value turned a few dead bytes into a half-hour `reset()`, and an allowance charged per node turned a
// 1.6 MB file into INT_MAX.

//
// NOT `is_number_integer()`: `get<int>()` static_casts any arithmetic node, so a capture spelling its
// field `2001.0` LOADS and a narrow guard would answer zero for it and drain for nothing (measured —
// the narrow guard also broke the `dilations` reader against base, which never guarded at all: base
// answered 3 for `"dilations":[2.0]` and the narrow version 0).
//
// A BOOLEAN IS A NUMBER TO `get<int>()` AND NOT TO `is_number()`, and that gap was a real under-drain.
// Measured on nlohmann 3.12: `get<int>(true)` is 1 while `get<long long>(true)` and `get<double>(true)`
// THROW. So NAM loads `"dilations":[true,true]` as `[1,1]` — verified, its own prewarm answers 3 — and

// replaying two samples at 0.1875 out of digital silence.
//
// AND A VALUE THAT DOES NOT FIT AN `int` IS REFUSED, because the model NAM built does not contain it.
// NAM's dilation IS an int; `"dilations":[4294967396]` builds a network whose dilation is 100, and a

//   real Standard inside `reset()`. Ignorance of N things is one ignorance, not N.
//   A floor as a MAX at the root lets a large known part SWALLOW the allowance: a read stack of
//   100 000 in series with an unreadable stage answers 100 000, i.e. the unknown stage is charged
//   ZERO — the one answer the rule forbids. Added, it is 148 000.
//
// WHY NOT FACE VALUE. An unplaced or set-aside number may be DEAD — NAM never builds it — and a dead
// number is not bounded by anything: `"receptive_field": 2147483647` beside a real Standard's stack is
// a file NAM loads unchanged, and trusting it made `reset()` spend about half an hour per lane. NAM
// allocates a LIVE stack of that length and refuses the load; a dead one costs NAM nothing. This file
// cannot tell the two apart without restating NAM's dispatch (rule 9u), so it trusts neither.
//
// 🔴 AND THE RULE HAS TWO DOORS, BOTH MEASURED, AND NEITHER CAN BE SHUT WITHOUT OPENING THE OTHER.
// (A differential fuzz of 2 000 loadable configs against NAM found no short answer outside these and
// the recurrent exception; these are what it found.)
//   D1 — a LIVE memory this file cannot place is charged the allowance, so one LONGER than the allowance
//     drains short by the difference: a wrapped model whose inner field is 60 000 drains 50 048 (the
//     row that measures it leaked 9 952 samples); a 60 001-tap `Linear` carrying a dead readable
//     `layers` array has its declared field SET ASIDE for the stack and drains 50 050. The longest field
//     of any real capture is 6347.
//   D2 — a DEAD number this file PLACES is trusted at face value, as it was before this rule: a lower
//     reading with no stack beside it (the two lower readings are maxed, as P87 ratified — a dead
//     `dilations:[2e9]` beside a `Linear`'s declared field), the wrapped form's own decoy stack (its
//     top-level `layers` are placed, and NAM builds from `config.model` instead — a decoy spelling
//     `dilations:[2000000]` drains two million samples), a `layers` array on an architecture that never
//     reads it. Base answered the same numbers for all of them.
// Treating EVERY uncertain config as unplaceable (dropping its own reading too) shuts D2 and widens D1
// to a live stack that merely has a dead sibling; trusting face value shuts D1 and reopens the
// half-hour `reset()` on 30 dead bytes. Which door stays open is a policy decision, and it is
// registered as one.
//
// THE NUMBER. 48 000 samples, a POLICY constant: 7.6x the longest field any real capture has
// (A2.nam's 6347), one second at 48 kHz and a quarter of one at 192 kHz — which in TIME is still 1.9x
// A2's 132 ms, because a capture built to cover the same milliseconds at a higher rate needs
// proportionally more samples. Against NAM's own half-second heuristic for an unbounded memory it is
// 2x at 48 kHz, 1x at 96 kHz and HALF at 192 kHz — said plainly, because a rounded comparison in a
// comment is this project's documented systemic leak.
//
// THE PRICE, MEASURED, because it is SPENT and not displayed. `configureRates` sizes `drainSamples_`
// from this number and `reset()` drives that many samples of silence through the network — and
// `reset()` is documented callable from the AUDIO thread, so this lands there, once per departure, per
// lane. Timed through `NamStage::reset()` itself on NAM's shipped captures, each made slimmable at full
// width and then WRAPPED, so the ledger charges 0 + 48 000 + the 2048 ring = 50 048 samples; M-series
// core, 48 kHz, one mono restart, median of seven:
//     capture                    as shipped             wrapped, block 256    block 64    block 1024
//     `wavenet_a1_standard.nam`  4093 samples  3.44 ms  39.7 ms               44.5 ms     37.5 ms
//     `A2.nam` (its submodel)    6347 samples  3.06 ms  24.1 ms
//     `slimmable_wavenet.nam`    2047 samples  0.19 ms   4.5 ms
// So a real capture arriving in a shape this file cannot place pays about 40 ms per lane plus what it
// placed — some 80 ms for a stereo restart, fifteen 256-sample callbacks at 48 kHz. That is a dropout,
// and it is the price of the rule; the alternative was 2046 samples of the previous sound.
//
// WHY NOT RATE-AWARE. Two of NAM's nine shipped captures — `my_model.nam` and
// `wavenet_a1_standard.nam` — carry NO `sample_rate` key at all (their top-level keys are
// `architecture, config, version, weights`), so a rate-aware allowance needs an absolute constant for
// the missing case anyway, which is two numbers where one does. And this file runs at

// carry base's exposure, which this file does not close: a 100 000-level chain overflows this walk on a
// small stack. In the load path NAM gets there first — `get_dsp` copies the config RECURSIVELY before

// not reading. It does NOT descend into arbitrary sub-objects: `metadata` — which sits on the MODEL
// node, a sibling of `config`, and is never visited from a model this file places — carries a real
// capture's free-form user tree (`training.data.latency.calibration...`), and a hunt through unschema'd
// JSON for words that look like a stack would invent memory for data nothing builds. `config` has a
// schema and `metadata` has not; that is the line, and it is structural.
// Two review seats argued against scanning the ENTRIES, on the grounds that a model there would be a
// new NAM dispatch and therefore a number in the plan; they are scanned anyway, because that argument
// was equally true of `config.model` until it was measured, and a false fire costs the allowance, which
// is the side the rule has already chosen.
//
// A config that is not an object is not iterated. NAM cannot load one (its parsers index the config by

// would find something: its elements would read as unplaced configs.
