        // message thread, with no callback to miss, and it is the price of one rule instead of two.
        // Skipping it where NAM's own prewarm provably covers the ledger is a real optimisation and is
        // registered as one rather than taken here: it is a predicate, and it would put back exactly
        // the kind of "this case does not need it" reasoning this fix exists to remove. P90 measured the
        // split (see NamStage.h, "SKIPPABLE ONLY PER ARCHITECTURE"): exact for every WaveNet NAM ships,
        // a 0.568 leak for a Linear — so the predicate is structural, belongs to the receptive-field
        // registry, and is P98.
        //
        // OUTSIDE the try on purpose: reset() is noexcept, so a throw inside it terminates rather than
        // landing in that catch, and putting it there would suggest otherwise. Skipped when this prepare
        // REFUSED, because chunking by a `maxBlock` a refused prepare already stored is a heap-buffer-
        // overflow (see reset()); the next prepare that succeeds restarts instead, owed or not — which

    // answers 0) nor the input buffer — `Buffer`'s per-channel window survives. Measured on a dense
    // 2001-tap capture at 48 kHz: a tone, then `NamStage::prepare()`, then digital silence at full
    // width returns 0.224604502320; through `reset()`, the same. P24 closed the half that was a falling
    // edge — a lane the host STOPS handing over is fed the silence it is receiving — and left this half,
    // the lane that is PRESENT, whose stale window speaks into the caller's own samples.
    //
    // WHAT IT PROMISES — the whole statement, with its numbers and its three exceptions, is on the public
    // declaration in NamStage.h. In short: every lane that carried audio is fed the digital silence it
    // still owes, here and in full, until its state is provably the state of a lane that was silent all
    // along. The promise is INDEPENDENCE — nothing the CALLER fed before the restart can be heard after
    // it — which is exact and is what the suite pins. It is NOT "silence comes out" (a capture answers
    // digital zero with its own biases: 0.001195220510 for a real Standard, 9.266554832458 for the
    // A2-max feature set), and it is not, in general, bit-identity with a stage prepared a moment ago,
    // because NAM's answer depends on how the stream is cut into calls: 1.037e-06 on a real Standard
    // where this restart's last chunk is short, and exactly 0 on a real slimmable at the same blocks.
    //
    // WHAT IT COSTS, because this is the one house verb here that is not O(block): one lane's whole
    // DRAIN LENGTH of inference per dirty lane — the field, plus the FFT ring a Linear is charged, plus
    // each leg's tap window. Real Standard WaveNet on an M-series core, per lane: 3.77 ms at a
    // 64-sample block (282 % of the callback), 3.62 at 128, 3.46 at 256, 3.43 at 512, 3.33 at 1024;
    // the A2 container 3.0-4.0 ms; a real LSTM 1.3 ms; a dense 2001-tap Linear 0.13 ms. It allocates,
    // locks, blocks and throws exactly where `process()` does — i.e. nowhere, for the architectures
    // whose NAM implementation preallocates — which is NOT every Linear and WaveNet: `wavenet_a2_max.nam`
    // from NAM's own examples allocates 4 times per sample in process() and therefore in here too
    // (measured), beside the LSTM/ConvNet exception the header already names. There is no cheaper
    // exact mechanism: asking NAM to Reset with its prewarm off zeroes the Conv1D rings in 0.014 ms and
    // still misses the prepared state by 4089 samples (worst 0.324) because that state is a PREWARMED
    // one, and on a Linear with the FFT engine it allocates 46 times.
    //
    // AND IT IS IDEMPOTENT, which is what keeps that price a one-off: the debt is re-armed only by audio
    // actually being fed, so a second restart with nothing in between spends nothing, and a mono host
    // pays for one lane rather than two.

// THE ONE ANSWER. Three facts, each written down exactly once, and the order between them is part of
// the contract rather than an accident of how the old code happened to be laid out.
//
//  1. NORMALISE. A model that reports no rate (<= 0) runs at the factory rate. This happens FIRST, so
//     the gate below compares against the rate the model will ACTUALLY run at. Reverse the two and an
//     untagged model at a 48 kHz host would be judged against 0 and come out "resampling".
//  2. GATE. A resampler is installed only past half a hertz of difference. Below that the rates are
//     the same clock as far as anything audible is concerned, and installing a 64-tap kernel to
//     convert 48000 to 48000.4 would cost 64 samples of delay to no purpose.
//  3. DERIVE, and only if one is installed. The geometry is core's — `pairDelayHostSamples` — and
//     the rounding is ours: the true delay is fractional and a host wants an integer, so round to
//     nearest. The residual is at most half a sample (worst on the shipped grid: 0.40 at 44.1 kHz,
//     whose first comb notch against an undelayed dry path sits at 55 kHz, out of band).
//
// 🔴 NOT GUARDED, DELIBERATELY — and what an absurd hostSR does has now been measured rather than
// reasoned about, because two earlier wordings of this paragraph were wrong about it. There are FOUR
// regimes against a 48 kHz model, not two (m = the model rate, the delay is 32 + 32·h/m):
//
//   h negative      → a perfectly finite, perfectly useless number (-48000 gives exactly 0).
//   h NaN           → fails the gate, returns 0 (the comparison itself raises FE_INVALID).
//   h > ~3.22e12    → lround is fine, but NARROWING ITS long TO int silently invents a plausible
//                     positive answer: h = 1e18 reports 1842981579 samples of latency, no flag raised.
//   h > ~1.38e22    → the value passes out of long's range too: lround saturates and FE_INVALID is
//                     raised. An INFINITE host lands in this same regime, which is why the earlier
//                     claim that "only an infinite host" gets this far was false: a finite 1e23
//                     reaches it identically, on every row measured.
//
// 🔴 AND THE ANSWER IN THE LAST TWO REGIMES IS PLATFORM-SPECIFIC, so no number is quoted for it here.
// Measured on four rows rather than reasoned about, because an earlier draft of this paragraph quoted
// "-1" and that is one toolchain's answer out of three:
//
//   arm64 macOS / x86-64 macOS (Apple libm) : lround saturates to LONG_MAX  → (int) = -1
//   x86-64 Debian (gcc 14 + glibc)          : lround saturates to LONG_MIN  → (int) =  0
//   x86-64 Windows (MSVC 19.44 + UCRT)      : long is 32 BITS, so lround saturates far earlier —
//                                             even the 1e18 case, where all three POSIX rows agree on
//                                             1842981579, reads 0 there.
//
// The two Mac rows and the Debian row share an ISA in one pairing and a toolchain in the other, which
// is what identifies libm rather than the ISA as the thing that differs. On the SHIPPED grid — 16 host
// rates x 3 model rates, up to the 3 MHz ceiling rigplayer now enforces — all four rows are
// byte-identical, so this divergence lives strictly outside the documented domain.
//
// None of that is new: the base commit's latencySamples() computed `lround(d + d*hostSR/modelRunSR)`
// with the same types and the same gate, so every one of the four regimes predates this extraction.
// Adding a guard would be a BEHAVIOUR change wearing a refactor's clothes, while this commit promises
// that no number moves. The one input that could divide by zero cannot reach the division: step 1
// turns a non-positive model rate into the factory rate. A real contract for absurd host rates is a
// separate question — and the consumer that actually sizes a buffer from this, rigplayer, no longer
// depends on the answer: it bounds its host rate before it asks.

// The worst an accepted model can cost this host — the number a consumer sizes a fixed delay line
// from. `pairDelayHostSamples` is monotonically DECREASING in the model rate (the return leg is
// converted at hostSR/modelSR) and the accepted window's low edge is kModelSampleRate -
// kModelRateTolerance, so one evaluation there dominates every accepted model and no search is needed.
// Asking at the NOMINAL rate instead — which is what a consumer does when it derives its own number
// from kModelSampleRate — reads up to 0.0208 samples short at a 3 MHz host, and a shortfall of any
// size is a delay line that clamps in silence.
//
// 🔴 IT ASKS THE GEOMETRY, NOT rateMatch(), AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. rateMatch's answer is zero
// whenever the two rates are within half a hertz, and that gate depends on the MODEL rate as well as
// the host's — so the window's low edge is not always the worst cell of rateMatch: at a 47999.5 Hz host
// the low edge costs nothing while the window's HIGH edge resamples and costs 64. Taking the geometry
// at the low edge is >= every accepted model's reported latency at every host, gate or no gate, which
// is the property a ring needs. As a BOUND it holds everywhere; as an attained maximum it has two
// exceptions, and both are stated because "exact" was claimed here once with only the first in mind:
// a host at exactly kModelSampleRate, where no accepted model resamples at all and the true maximum is
// 0 (64 slots of a ring, paid so the rule has no exception in the code); and any host so slow that no
// backend can be PREPARED for it at all, where the stage stays at zero because it never runs. This is
// a policy answer about rates, not a promise about a particular prepared instance.
